# Important Notice: This Code Contains Malware – Do Not Execute

# RoLinked/Vlk Games/Vik Games – Roblox Credential-Stealing Malware

## Overview

### Description:

This sophisticated malware targets Roblox users, initiated through a bookmarklet on the attacker's website (rolinked[.]com, rolinked[.]co). Upon activation, it injects malicious code into the Roblox website, displaying fraudulent prompts to deceive users into providing their two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The malware is highly obfuscated to prevent reverse engineering, making it difficult to detect and analyze.

### Key Features:

-   **Initial Contact**: The attack begins when the attacker lures the user to their site, where they are prompted to drag a bookmarklet to their bookmarks bar and execute it on the Roblox website.
-   **Injection**: The malware is injected into the Roblox site through the bookmarklet, enabling the attacker to manipulate the user interface.
-   **2FA and Security Bypass**: It manipulates the Roblox interface to obtain the user’s 2FA code and other security details, including parental control PINs.
-   **Account Takeover**:
    -   Alters the user’s date of birth to 2/2/2022, exploiting COPPA regulations to prevent account recovery.
    -   Changes the registered email to the attacker’s email, disabling password protection.
    -   Previously, it would check for Robux and purchase scam products, though this behavior is currently inactive and not present in the code.
