# RoLinked/Vlk Games/Vik Games – Roblox Credential-Stealing Malware

## Overview

A sophisticated piece of malware has been identified, targeting Roblox users and compromising their accounts through deceptive methods. This malware is delivered via a bookmarklet on the attacker's websites (rolinked[.]com, rolinked[.]co) and is specifically designed to steal users' credentials, including their two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The code is highly obfuscated, making it difficult to detect or reverse-engineer, which allows it to operate stealthily.

## How It Works

- **Initial Contact**: The attack begins when users are tricked into visiting the attacker's website, where they are instructed to drag a bookmarklet to their bookmarks bar. When executed on the Roblox website, this bookmarklet injects the malicious code.
  
- **Malicious Injection**: Once injected, the malware manipulates the Roblox interface, displaying fake prompts that convince users to provide sensitive information, including their 2FA codes.

- **Security Bypass and Account Takeover**: The malware collects the 2FA code and other security details, such as parental control PINs. It then takes control of the user's account by:
  - Changing the date of birth to 2/2/2022, exploiting COPPA regulations to hinder account recovery.
  - Altering the registered email to the attacker’s email, thereby disabling password recovery options.
  - Previously, the malware also checked for Robux and purchased scam products, though this feature is currently inactive.

## Protection Measures

To safeguard against this malware and similar threats:

- **Stay Vigilant**: Be cautious when interacting with off-platform websites, especially those that ask you to execute code.
- **Avoid Suspicious Links**: Do not click on links from untrusted or unknown sources.
- **Do Not Execute Unverified Code**: Never run code from untrusted sources, whether it’s a bookmarklet or a script in the developer console.

By adhering to these safety practices, you can protect yourself from potential threats targeting your Roblox account and other online platforms.
